// Potential linking (draft)

// Run through the theory solving the equations

// Consider two weakly coupled lossless resonators. Denote the amplitude with the time dependence in one resonator by a1 the amplitude in the other resonator by a2   

a1 = exp(j*w1*t)
a2 = exp(j*w2*t)

// These are the positive frequency components of the electric field amplitudes. They obey the differential equations
